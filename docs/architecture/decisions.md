# Architecture decisions

The owner decided these on 2026-10-20 after talking through the options. Each entry gives the decision, the reason, and what was rejected. Platform facts are in [grounding.md](grounding.md).

## ADR-001: Local storage is SQLite through GRDB

- **Decision:** SQLite (WAL mode, FTS5 for offline full-text search) accessed through [GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift). It is the single approved third-party dependency.
- **Why:**
  - A mail client is a large indexed table of headers, with many-to-many labels and text search. SQLite does this best.
  - GRDB supplies migrations, observation, FTS and multi-process support, so we don't write and maintain our own layer.
- **Rejected:**
  - SwiftData: unproven at 100k+ messages, slow many-to-many queries, no FTS.
  - Core Data: no FTS.
  - Raw SQLite C API: about 1–2k lines of wrapper we'd own.
- **Rule:** only the `MailStore` package imports GRDB.

## ADR-002: App and Notification Service Extension both write

- **Decision:** the app and the NSE both write to the shared database in the App Group container, using a GRDB `DatabasePool`. Widgets only read.
- **Why:** the NSE can persist the messages it fetches, so the app shows them on open without fetching them again.
- **Obligations:**
  - Writes are short transactions, finished before the extension returns. iOS kills a suspended process that holds a lock in a shared container (`0xdead10cc`).
  - Every process handles `SQLITE_BUSY` with a busy timeout.
  - Cross-process changes are announced with a Darwin notification, and the other process re-reads.
  - Database files use `NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication` so the NSE can open them while the phone is locked.
- **Rejected:** the app as the only writer, with the NSE handing new mail over in a side file.

## ADR-003: One web view per message

- **Decision:** each message in a thread renders in its own `WKWebView`:
  - Collapsed messages aren't rendered.
  - Email JavaScript is off.
  - A `WKContentRuleList` blocks remote content by default.
  - `cid:` images are served by a `WKURLSchemeHandler`.
  - Our own script, in an isolated `WKContentWorld`, measures height and applies `dir=auto`.
- **Why:** per-message actions, accessibility and RTL stay simple, and it matches Apple Mail.
- **Rejected:** one web view per thread, which scrolls more smoothly but makes all of the above harder.

## ADR-004: Programmatic UIKit for the core UI

- **Decision:** UIKit for every core surface:
  - `UISplitViewController`
  - `UICollectionView` with diffable data sources and list layout
  - `UITextView` on TextKit 2 for compose
  - reactivity through Observation (automatic tracking, `updateProperties()`) and trait collections
- **Never** Storyboards or XIBs; all UI is programmatic.
- **SwiftUI is allowed only for:** WidgetKit, App Intents snippets, and simple low-traffic settings forms hosted in UIKit.
- **Why:** the owner's call, for performance and smoothness. UIKit gives the most control over list scrolling and rich-text editing.

## ADR-005: Local Swift packages split by knowledge

- **`MailCore`:** domain types (Account, Thread, Message, Label, Mailbox), the provider protocol, the sync engine, the outbox. Pure Swift, no UIKit.
- **`MailStore`:** GRDB schema, migrations, queries, cross-process change notices. Nothing else imports GRDB.
- **`GmailProvider`:** Gmail REST and JSON, OAuth, history sync, watch renewal. It converts everything into `MailCore` types, and no Gmail wire type escapes it. `OutlookProvider` and `ICloudProvider` come later as siblings.
- **`MailUI`:** UIKit screens and components, theme with account colors, RTL helpers.
- **Targets:** the app (thin wiring), the NSE (MailCore, MailStore, GmailProvider, never MailUI), widgets.
- **Why:** the compiler enforces the boundaries, so Gmail code can't leak into the UI and only `MailStore` sees the database.
- **Rejected:** one target with folders (no enforcement); per-feature packages (premature).

## ADR-006: Push backend is a TypeScript Worker with D1

- **Decision:** a Cloudflare Worker in TypeScript with zero runtime dependencies. APNs JWT signing and Google OIDC/ID-token checks use WebCrypto.
- **Dev tooling only:** `wrangler`, `typescript`, and the Cloudflare Vitest integration.
- **Storage:** D1 holds HMAC(email) → device tokens and APNs environment. Duplicate Pub/Sub deliveries are dropped by a conditional write on `(account, historyId)`.
- **Why:** D1 is the simplest fit for one table and has generous free limits.
- **Rejected:**
  - Durable Objects: more moving parts now; reconsider for iCloud.
  - KV: only 1k writes a day on the free plan, and eventually consistent.

## ADR-007: Windowed offline cache

- **Headers:**
  - 90 days for Inbox, Sent, Starred and Drafts; 30 days for other labels.
  - Older mail is fetched on scroll or search.
- **Bodies:** the newest ~500 threads prefetched on Wi-Fi, the rest on demand, under a 1 GB cap with least-recently-used eviction.
- **Attachments:** on demand.
- **Search:** local FTS answers instantly, then Gmail server search fills in.
- **Rejected:** mirroring everything (multi-GB, long first sync); user-configurable windows (not for v1).

## ADR-008: Outbox replays intents idempotently

- **Decision:** user actions apply to the local store immediately and are queued as intents, for example "archive thread T". Replay sends exactly the intent, so a repeat is harmless. No merge dialogs, ever.
- **Failures:**
  - If the target is gone on the server, the intent is dropped silently.
  - Only failures the user must know about, such as a failed send, are shown.

## ADR-009: Google OAuth is "In production", unverified, for TestFlight

- **Decision:** publish the OAuth consent screen as "In production" without verification.
- **Why:** Testing mode expires refresh tokens after 7 days, which would force a weekly sign-in and break push.
- **Accepted costs:** a one-time "unverified app" warning at sign-in, and a cap of 100 users.

## ADR-010: Sync tests run on scrubbed recorded fixtures

- **Decision:** record Gmail API responses from a dedicated test Gmail account that the owner provides, never a personal inbox. A script strips personal data, and the fixtures are committed.
- **Tests:** sync and provider tests run offline against them with Swift Testing.
